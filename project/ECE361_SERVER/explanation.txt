Group Code: w7s9

The project is mainly divided into two parts.

The first part is the shortest path computation, and it realizes the following:
-  Get node information from the server and organize them
-  Uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between any two node
-  Return the shortest path from node 0(self) to node "node -1"(server)

The second part is the file transfer, and it realizes the following :
-  If a file exists, send the file name and no of packets to the server
-  Create a 2D byte array to store the content of the file
-  Create a new thread to continuously update "lastAck"
-  Transfer the file in packets of size of 1004
-  Adjust the cwnd window accordingly
-  Retransmit the lost packets
-  Reset cwnd and ssthresh in case of timeout

Thank you  and have a great day!
